					<p>In python I created a GUI and agorithm to rate the squares on the board and decide which is the best move. I originally started this project because I had never made a program with a GUI before. However my favorite part was coming up with an algorithm to rate the squares. Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple enough game that its possible to simply play out every possible game and move and find the best option. However I didn't want to do this, instead I tried emulate my own thought process. I decide which square is best to play in based which squares have already been played in. I came up with an function that rates the squares based on the combination of squares already played and picks the highest rated square. I also added a random element if squares have the same rating to make the game more interesting. In the futer I want to translate this game to JavaScript so I can post it online.</p>
